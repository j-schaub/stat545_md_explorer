# STAT 545: Participation

A repository for submitting in-class activities for participation marks

This line was added locally.

This repo is organized in the following way:
1. **CM003 and earlier** : The files were just added to the general repo
2. **CM004 and later** : Files associated with each lecture have their own folder, labelled accordingly

Note: This was formerly a repo for a Markdown Exploration activity, and some files are artifacts of this
